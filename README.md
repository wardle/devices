# devices

Medical devices are important and tracking their use for patients across health systems essential for safety and quality and resource utilisation.

There have been high profile issues in which recalls of faulty products have been required, such as breast implants or mesh devices for repair of hernias. Similarly, medical devices must be regulated - medical device regulation (MDR) and in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation (IVDR) - so individual devices can be mapped to categories, groups and types. 

A fundamental part of managing and tracking devices are standardised nomenclatures relating to the types of devices.
